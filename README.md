# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think that is was a great project, and I really enjoyed it! I think that this project could maybe benefit from maybe 1 or 2 more animations like the circle. Since that was so prominent in the learning material I think people would like more practice at it.
